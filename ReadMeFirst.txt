This is A Django Web Framework based forum implementing Bootstrap and CSS.

This Forum works but I was not able to create a comments section on posts put up by the user as I did not know how to do it but would love to learn that..


To create A virtual environment- 

1.Clone the Github Repository and go into the directory "IMGDev-master"

2.Run command "virtualenv -p python3 . "

3.Start The Virtual Environment using the command "source bin/activate"



To start off this Forum-

1.Install Django 2.0.7 on the system. (error might be prompted in case Django is already installed)

2.Change into "src" directory.

3.Run the command "python manage.py runserver"

4.Now go to the link "localhost:8000/login" .

5.Proceed with using the forum! :)
