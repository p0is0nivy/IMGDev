This is A Django Web Framework based forum implementing Bootstrap and CSS.

This Forum works but I was not able to create a comments section on posts put up by the user as I did not know how to do it but would love to learn that..

To start off this Forum-

1.Create  A virtual environment in the current directory.

2.Start The virtual environment.

3.Install Django 2.0 on the system. (error might be prompted in case Django is already installed)

4.Change into "src" directory.

5.Run the command "python manage.py runserver"

6.Now go to the link "localhost:8000/login" .

7.Proceed with using the forum! :)
